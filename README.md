<h1> Introduction </h1>

For this project, I made a dungeon-delving terminal game called Occluded Foresight. This took me more than a week to make, but I very much had a fun experience making this. I'd be delighted to have your feedback on this :)

In this game, you navigate blindly through a crumbling crypt. Your objective is to collect all of the treasures inside it and find the portal to escape before the entire crypt collapses. Despite not being able to see anything, you will be guided by your character's intuition to locate the treasures and escape (thus the name 'Occluded Foresight').

<h1> Usage </h1>

Since this is a terminal-based game, simply:
1. Clone the repository (https://github.com/Koriyu/Occluded-Foresight)
2. Open the terminal based on the location of the repository
3. Run the following command on your terminal: `python3 "Occluded Foresight.py"`
4. Enjoy :)
